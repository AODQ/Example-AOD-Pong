        <h1>AODCore.clientvars</h1>
Used to keep track of variables defined by the client. This mostly at the
  moment is just keybinds which give the user a direct interface to the console
  through keypresses. Since there are no native console commands, what the user
  can do is completely up to the application writer. In the future audio and
  display settings will be stored here.

<dl><dt><big><a name="Keybind"></a>struct <u>Keybind</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>A binded key<br><br>

<dl><dt><big><a name="Keybind.key"></a>int <u>key</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>A valid <a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Scancode">SDL_SCANCODE</a>
         or AOD.Mouse_Bind<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="Keybind.command"></a>string <u>command</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>A console <u>command</u>, in the majority of cases the user will probably expect
      the console <u>command</u> to occur when the 'key' is pressed<br><br>

</dd>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="keybinds"></a>Keybind[] <u>keybinds</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>How you wish to use this is entirely up to you. For the majority of cases
  I'd expect the entire array to be iterated and if a key was pressed then the
  associated command would be executed. AOD does not touch this outside of
  Load_Config though
  for the majority of cases I'd expect the entire array to be iterated and
  if a key is pressed then the command will be executed.<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big><a name="Load_Config"></a>void <u>Load_Config</u>();
</big></dt>
<dd>Loads the user config from "config.ini" and stores results in keybinds.<br>
  Will clear keybinds beforehand<br><br>
